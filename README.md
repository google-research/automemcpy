Website accompanying the `automemcpy` paper from Chatelet et al. (https://doi.org/10.1145/3459898.3463904).

# Code

The code for the autogenerated functions is available in the `code` folder.

# Measurements

The measurements folder contains the raw measurements for the following microarchitectures:
 - x86-64 AMD  : rome
 - x86-64 Intel: skylake
 - x86-64 Intel: ivybridge
 - x86-64 Intel: sandybridge
 - x86-64 Intel: broadwell
 - x86-64 Intel: haswell
 - ARM         : neoverse-n1

The corresponding csv files have one measurement per line.
There are SAMPLES x FUNCTIONS x DISTRIBUTIONS measurements.

 - SAMPLES is 250 (downsampled from the 1000 samples as stated in the paper).
 - FUNCTIONS is 290 for x86-64, and 60 for ARM
 - DISTRIBUTIONS is 10.

Distributions can be found in the [llvm-libc github repo](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/97f4789c38f6cab60c10c5132816bc4822503a79/libc/benchmarks/MemorySizeDistributions.cpp#L32)

The `memcpy_default_db.csv` file contains the description of the parameters used to generate the functions.
